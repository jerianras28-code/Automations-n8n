# Short Story
this was when we got our first partner in business and my task (since his company was a second hand dealership) was to help relieve his time by building an automation that automatically scrapes vehicle listings with phone numbers for him and his sales team.

# Basic Description
Super Simple explination: The workflow goes through the top most recent listings on Facebook and then it starts filtering them out.
It checks if the listings : are vehicle for sale or for parts, has a phonenumber and then adds the filter information to the datababse.
Then the database checks for phonenumber duplicates and what is left from all the filters gets destibuted equally to the sales team on their google sheets.
