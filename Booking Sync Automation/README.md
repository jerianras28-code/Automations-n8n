# Short Story

This workflow was one of my very first proudction workflows I made.
Long story short. The client was a property management company that wanted every scheduling/booking displayed structurely on their google calendar from their external apps(Hosfully and Monday.com).
So before building the workflow I know there were key things i had to stick to such as: minimal/no AI implementation, keep my mindset in a (what value would this provide?) state, and convient structuring for the client.


# Basic Description
Super simple explination:The workflow connects to the clients hostfully platform and collects all bookings of every property that gets placed and it then displays the information on the clients google calendar.
